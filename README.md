# KONALIB

This project's purpose is to provide examples of how to incorporate C libraries in KONA

```sh
make install # clone and build kona / copy necessary files
make build   # compile t.c to ./obj/t.so
```

Certain files in the kona project need edits in order to build correctly 

Those edits are stored in `./extern` and copied during `make install`
